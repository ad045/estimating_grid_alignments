# estimating_grid_alignments

### Note on the MATLAB scripts: 
I've included two MATLAB scripts for extracting voxel time series from a NIfTI file to a CSV. The script named starting with "V1w_" is confirmed to work; I previously used the shorthand "w" to denote scripts that are operational. I believe the other script is simply a version that I had cleaned up for readability using ChatGPT, and it should produce identical results. However, to ensure reliability, I have also included the tested version.


### Note on the python / google colab scripts: 
I've included two Google Colab scripts that showcase how I've utilized LSTM and LTC models in general. The code is bad, and if you're interested, I would be happy to organize my collection of Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook files into a more structured set of Python scripts and share them with you. Please let me know if this would be helpful! I could allocate a weekend after October 21st for it.
