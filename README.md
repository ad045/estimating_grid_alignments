# estimating_grid_alignments

### Note on MATLAB Scripts: 
I've included two MATLAB scripts for extracting voxel time series from a NIfTI file to a CSV. The script named starting with "V1w_" is confirmed to work; I previously used the shorthand "w" to denote scripts that are operational. I believe the other script is simply a version that I had cleaned up for readability using ChatGPT, and it should produce identical results. However, to ensure reliability, I have also included the tested version.
